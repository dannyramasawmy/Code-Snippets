## Scripting
### Arrays
Arrays can be created like this:
```
$A = 1,2,3,4,5
$B = 7
$C = 5..8
$a = @(<a number of statements>) # make an array from statements
```
You can use `.` notation to access properties of the object
```
$A.Length # . + tab to see available methods
```
Indexing variables:
```
$A[0] 
$A[2] 
$A[1..4] 
$A[-3..-1] 
```

### Loops
Foreach loops:
```
$a = 0..9
foreach ($e in $a) {
 $e
}
```
